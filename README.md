### Make your own cast type for Laravel model attributes

Laravel custom casts works similarly to [Laravel attribute casting](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting), but with our customly defined logic (in separated class). Beside casting to
our complex types this package gives us ability to listen and react to underlying model events.

Let's check out some Laravel common cast types and possible example of their usage:

```php
namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'is_admin' => 'boolean',
        'login_count' => 'integer'
        'height' => 'decimal:2'
    ];
}
```

Beside `bolean`, `integer` and `decimal` from the example above, out of the box Laravel supports `real`, `float`, `double`, `string`, `object`, `array`, `collection`, `date`, `datetime`, and `timestamp` casts.

Sometimes it is convenient to handle more complex types with custom logic and ability to listen and react to model events. This is where this package come in handy.

>Handling events directly from custom casts could be very useful if we're, for e.g. storing image with custom casts and we need to delete it when the model gets deleted. *Checkout the [old documentation](https://github.com/vkovic/laravel-custom-casts/tree/v1.0.2#example-casting-user-image) for this example.*

### :package:

Some time ago, when 1k downloads of this repo was near, I decided to make one more package. It's in early stage but you can check it or maybe even help me improve it.

Basically it's a collection of Laravel `artisan` commands I've been using oftenly. So I decided to squeeze them into this interesting Laravel plugin.

Check it out: [vkovic/laravel-commando](http://bit.ly/2GT7DV7)

### :package:

---

## Compatibility

The package is compatible with Laravel versions `5.5`, `5.6`, `5.7`, `5.8` and `6`

## Installation

Install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require vkovic/laravel-custom-casts
```

## Usage

### Utilizing a custom casts class

To enable custom casts in our models, we need to use `HasCustomCasts` trait and we need to define which filed will be casted - per Laravel standards.

```php
// File: app/User.php

namespace App;

use App\CustomCasts\NameCast;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Vkovic\LaravelCustomCasts\HasCustomCasts;

class User extends Model
{
    use HasCustomCasts;

    protected $casts = [
        'is_admin' => boolean // <-- Laravel default cast type
        'name' => NameCast::class // <-- Our custom cast class (follow section below)
    ];
}
```

### Defining custom cast class

This class will be responsible for our custom casting logic.

```php
// File: app/CustomCasts/NameCast.php

namespace App\CustomCasts;

use Vkovic\LaravelCustomCasts\CustomCastBase;

class NameCast extends CustomCastBase
{
    public function setAttribute($value)
    {
        return ucwords($value);
    }

    public function castAttribute($value)
    {
        return $this->getTitle() . ' ' . $value;
    }

    protected function getTitle()
    {
        return ['Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Ms.', 'Miss'][rand(0, 3)];
    }
}
```

Required `setAttribute` method receives `$value` that we're setting on our model field and should return raw value that we want to store in our database.

Optional `getAttribute` method receives raw `$value` from database and should return mutated value. If we omit this method, raw value from database will be returned.

For the sake of this example we'll implement one more method which will attach random title to our users
when name is returned from database.

### Let's test it

Let's create a user and see what will happen.

```php
$user = new App\User;
$user->name = 'john doe';

$user->save();
```

This will create our new user and his name will be stored in the database, first letters uppercased.

When we retrieve our user and try to get his name, title will be prepended to it, just like we defined it
in our custom `NameCast` class.

```php
dd($user->name); // 'Mr. John Doe'
```

### Handling model events

Let's say that we want to notify our administrator when user name changes.

```php
// File: app/CustomCasts/NameCast.php

public function updated()
{
    $attribute = $this->attribute;

    if($this->model->isDirty($attribute)) {
        // Notify admin about name change
    }
}
```

Beside `updated` method, we can as well create other methods for standard model events:
`retrieved`, `creating`, `created`, `updating`, `saving`, `saved`, `deleting`, `deleted`, `restoring` and `restored`.

### Other functionality

As you can assume from code above, we can easily access casted attribute name as well as instance of underlying model.

```php
// File: app/CustomCasts/NameCast.php

// Get model attribute name being casted
dd($this->attribute); // 'name'

// Access our `User` model
dd(get_class($this->model)); // 'App/User'
```

Beside this we can retrieve all casted attributes and their corresponding classes directly from our model.

```php
// File: app/User.php

dd($this->getCustomCasts()); // ['name' => 'App/CustomCasts/NameCast']
```

### More examples

You can find more examples on the [old documentation](https://github.com/vkovic/laravel-custom-casts/tree/v1.0.2#example-casting-user-image).

## Contributing

If you plan to modify this Laravel package you should run tests that comes with it.
Easiest way to accomplish this would be with `Docker`, `docker-compose` and `phpunit`.

First, we need to initialize Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

After that, we can run tests and watch the output:

```bash
docker-compose exec app vendor/bin/phpunit
```
